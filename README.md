# SharedPreferences
 
The user is asked to fill out some fields: Name (String), Roll No. (Int), Price (Float) and Color (Radio Group). An empty ImageView with color white has been added. As soon as the user fills the fields and chooses the color, he has to click the 'Apply Changes' button. This will set the Prefernces for the next time when the user will open the app.

The 'Clear' button can be used to clear the set shared preferences.
